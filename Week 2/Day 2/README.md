### Steps to Run:

3. `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the requirements

# Build 🏗️

Run the notebook! 

For a more "interactive" experience - you can reference the [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10yLbdblldyP49YEJNxh-ndl3n9Bf4pLu?usp=sharing) - but the preference would be for you to use the local environment as always.
