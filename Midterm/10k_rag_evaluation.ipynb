      "Answer: The potential impacts on our products and services due to changes in user behavior, engagement with our platform, advertising practices, and marketer satisfaction include:\n",
      "- Decreased user retention, growth, and engagement, particularly for revenue-generating products like Facebook and Instagram, which could adversely affect revenue and financial results.\n",
      "- Loss of marketers or reduction in spending by marketers, which could seriously harm our business as substantially all of our revenue is generated from advertising on Facebook and Instagram.\n",
      "- Adverse effects on advertising revenue due to factors such as decreases in user engagement, changes in user access and engagement with our products, product changes affecting ad display, limitations on ad delivery, and changes in ad pricing or demand.\n",
      "- Impact on ad targeting and measurement tools due to regulatory developments, changes in data signal availability, and limitations imposed by mobile operating system and browser providers, which could negatively affect advertising revenue.\n",
      "- Potential negative effects on revenue and financial results if user perception of our products as useful, reliable, and trustworthy diminishes, leading to difficulty in attracting or retaining users and maintaining user engagement levels.\n",

      "Question: How are gains or losses in interest and other income (expense), net accounted for in the consolidated statements of income, considering the fair value hierarchy and the measurement alternative for non-marketable equity securities?\n",
      "Answer: Gains or losses in interest and other income (expense), net related to non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the measurement alternative are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. When indicators of impairment exist and the estimated fair value of an investment is below the carrying amount, the investment is written down to fair value. The change in carrying value, including any gains or losses resulting from the remeasurements, is then recognized in interest and other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of income. This accounting treatment aligns with the fair value hierarchy, specifically Level 3, as it involves significant unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of non-marketable equity securities.\n",
      "****\n",
      "Question: How does the conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock and the inclusion of RSUs awards under the Equity Incentive Plan affect the weighted-average number of shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share?\n",
      "Answer: The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock and the inclusion of RSUs awards under the Equity Incentive Plan affect the weighted-average number of shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share by increasing the total number of shares outstanding. This increase in shares impacts the denominator in the EPS calculation, resulting in a lower EPS figure due to the dilution effect of additional shares.\n",

      "Answer: The potential consequences of cyber-attacks on the company's business, reputation, or financial results include:\n",
      "1. Difficulty in detecting sophisticated and evolving cyber-attacks, leading to potential long periods of undetected breaches.\n",
      "2. Limitations of data protection measures may result in data loss, misuse, or improper access to user data.\n",
      "3. Involvement of third parties in storing or handling data may lead to improper access, use, or disclosure of company or user data.\n",

      "6. Decline in active user base or engagement levels due to security incidents, impacting the company's business and financial results.\n",
      "7. Intentional misuse of services and user data by third parties may adversely affect the company's reputation and brands.\n",
      "Overall, these consequences highlight the potential negative impact of cyber-attacks on the company's operations and overall performance.\n",
      "****\n",
      "Question: What legal actions has the FTC taken regarding the company's alleged antitrust violations in relation to Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions?\n",
      "Answer: The FTC filed a complaint against the company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act. The FTC sought a permanent injunction against the company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, as well as other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. The court granted the company's motion to dismiss the initial complaint but denied the motion to dismiss the amended complaint. Multiple putative class actions have also been filed against the company alleging violations of antitrust laws in connection with these acquisitions.\n",

      "Question: How are gains or losses in interest and other income (expense), net accounted for in the consolidated statements of income, considering the fair value hierarchy and the measurement alternative for non-marketable equity securities?\n",
      "Answer: Gains or losses in interest and other income (expense), net related to non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the measurement alternative are recognized in the interest and other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of income. This recognition occurs when indicators of impairment exist and the estimated fair value of an investment is below the carrying amount, leading to a write-down of the investment to fair value. The change in carrying value, along with any gains or losses resulting from the remeasurements, are reflected in the interest and other income (expense), net section of the consolidated statements of income.\n",

      "Question: How does the conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock and the inclusion of RSUs awards under the Equity Incentive Plan affect the weighted-average number of shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share?\n",
      "Answer: The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock and the inclusion of RSUs awards under the Equity Incentive Plan affect the weighted-average number of shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share by increasing the total number of shares outstanding. This increase in shares impacts the denominator of the EPS calculation, leading to a lower EPS value due to the dilution effect caused by the additional shares.\n",

      "Answer: The potential consequences of cyber-attacks on the company's business, reputation, or financial results include negative effects on user trust and engagement, harm to the company's reputation and brands, changes to business practices adverse to the company, adverse effects on business and financial results, significant costs in protecting against or remediating such incidents, legal and regulatory actions leading to fines, orders, or consent decrees modifying business practices, decline in active user base or engagement levels, and intentional misuse of services and user data adversely affecting the company's business.\n",
