As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large financial institutions and our investment\\nholdings are in diversified highly rated securities. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $65.40\\xa0billion as of December\\xa031, 2023, an increase\\nof $24.67\\xa0billion from December\\xa031, 2022. The increase was mostly due to $71.11\\xa0billion of cash generated from operations, and $8.46 billion of net proceeds\\nfrom the issuance of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes (the Notes) in May 2023. These increases were partially offset by $28.10 billion for capital expenditures,\\nincluding principal payments on finance leases, $19.77\\xa0billion for repurchases of our Class\\xa0A common stock, and $7.01\\xa0billion of taxes paid related to net share\\nsettlement of employee restricted stock unit (RSU) awards.\\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December\\xa031,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nNet cash provided by operating activities\\n$\\n71,113\\xa0\\n$\\n50,475\\xa0\\n$\\n57,683\\xa0\\nNet cash used in investing activities\\n$\\n(24,495)\\n$\\n(28,970)\\n$\\n(7,570)\\nNet cash used in financing activities\\n$\\n(19,500)\\n$\\n(22,136)\\n$\\n(50,728)\\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\\nCash provided by operating activities during 2023 mostly consisted of $39.10\\xa0 billion net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as\\n$14.03\\xa0billion of share-based compensation expense and $11.18 billion of depreciation and amortization expense, as well as $3.29 billion of favorable changes\\nin working capital. The increase in cash flows from operating activities during 2023 compared to 2022 was mostly due to an increase in cash collection from\\nour customers driven by the increase in revenue, and a decrease in payments to our vendors.\\nCash Used in Investing Activities\\nCash used in investing activities during 2023 mostly consisted of $27.05\\xa0billion of net purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest in\\ndata centers, servers, and network infrastructure, partially offset by $3.20\\xa0billion net proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable debt securities. The\\ndecrease in cash used in investing activities during 2023 compared to 2022 was mostly due to a decrease in purchases of property and equipment.\\nWe anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $30\\xa0billion to $37\\xa0billion in 2024.\\nCash Used in Financing Activities\\nCash used in financing activities during 2023 mostly consisted of $19.77\\xa0billion for repurchases of our Class\\xa0A common stock and $7.01\\xa0billion of taxes\\npaid related to net share settlement of RSUs, partially offset by $8.46\\xa0billion proceeds from the issuance of the Notes in May 2023.
